# Teawars Lite

vision: run teawars completely in browser, so other streamers can use it, too with their own chat

Questions

- how to parametrize the twitch channel in browser (idea: query string parameter)
- How to parametrize moderators?
- how to deploy to the public internet? (idea: AWS S3)- Risk: Does S3 work with query string parameters?

Todos

- migrate chatbot (i.e. listen to twitch)
- migrate logic (adventurer, battle, party, monster, etc)
